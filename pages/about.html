            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Founded in 2025, Grandya Coffee was born from a passion for quality coffee and community. Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a space where people could come together over a great cup of coffee. From our humble beginnings, we have grown into a beloved local spot, known for our premium coffee sourced directly from Mondulkiri.</p>
            <p>Over the years, we have built strong relationships with local farmers, ensuring that every bean we serve is ethically sourced and of the highest quality. Our commitment to sustainability and supporting the local economy is at the heart of everything we do. We believe that great coffee starts with great people, and we are proud to work alongside dedicated growers who share our values.</p>
            <p>As our community has grown, so too has our menu and our space. We have expanded to offer a variety of pastries, snacks, and specialty drinks, all crafted with the same care and attention as our coffee. Our café has become a gathering place for friends, families, and travelers alike—a welcoming environment where everyone can feel at home.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, we remain dedicated to our mission of bringing people together and sharing the best of Cambodian coffee culture. We are grateful for the support of our customers and community, and we look forward to many more years of serving you at Grandya Coffee.</p>
